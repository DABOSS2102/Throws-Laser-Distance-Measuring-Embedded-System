# Throws-Laser-Distance-Measuring-Embedded-System
This repo contains the code I used to run a custom measuring device. The measuring device was designed to measure the distances of throws for the Track and Field events: shotput, discus, hammer, and weight. The measuring device utilized a laser to measure the distance.
